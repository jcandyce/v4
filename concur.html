<h3>About</h3>
<p> I was a product management intern at SAP Concur on the Expense Pay team. I spent the summer doing a lot of research to help postion a potential new product offering. To help speak to the viability of the potential new product offering, I interviewed product marketers, market insight managers, implementation and solutions consultants. I also did a good amount of competitive and background research on different reimbursement offerings, international banks, bank specific files, and country specific files. </p>
